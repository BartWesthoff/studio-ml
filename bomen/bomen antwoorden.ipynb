Adding weights for their size, you'd get $1 - (0.6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} + 0.4 \\times \\frac{2}{2}) = 1 -(0.4 + 0.4) = 0.2$, so this is certainly a split we'd be willing to make.\n","\n","Let's describe this a bit more formally.\n","\n","Let $M$ be the ordered set of classes and $||M||$ the number of classes. $M$ is ordered by frequency.

Both are named after the statistician Corrado Gini.\n","\n","The central idea is as follows. If a node is \"pure\", that is, all instances in it belong to the same class, then predicting the class of an instance is trivial. A pure node has a Gini index of 0. If a node isn't pure yet - meaning it has instances of more than one class in it, then we can calculate just how hard it is to classify instances in that node.\n","\n","Suppose we know the distribution of class labels in a node. For example, we could have a node with `A, A, A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B` in it. Then if we grabbed a random instance, we'd have 60% chance of `A` and 40% chance of `B`. Now suppose we get a new instance and we have to predict its label, and we use those probabilities that we know. So there's a 60% chance that we predict `A`, and 40% chance that we predict `B`. Now, how often are we wrong? That's what Gini impurity measures.\n","\n","The odds of us being wrong are those of predicting `A` but getting `B` ($0.6 \\times 0.4 = 0.24$) and of predicting `B` but getting `A` ($0.4 \\times 0.6 = 0.24$), so a total of $0.24 + 0.24 = 0.48$. This is the same as 1 minus the chance of us getting it right, so $1 - (0.6^2 + 0.4^2) = 0.48$.\n","\n","Now imagine we have a proposed split of this node, that would result in child nodes `A, B, B, B, B` and `A, A, A, A, A`. The odds of getting it wrong in the first node are $1 - (0.2^2 + 0.8^2) = 0.32$. For the other node, the odds of getting it wrong are 0, because there's only one class to choose from. Their weights are each $\\frac{5}{10} = 0.5$ because each node is half the size of the original. So we multiply these impurities with their weights based on instances and get $(0.5 \\times 0.32) + (0.5 \\times 0) = 0.16. This is better than our original impurity of 0.48, so we'd be willing to make this split.\n","\n","Let's formalize Gini Index in a formula:\n","\n","$$Gini = 1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{||M||} p_j^2$$\n","\n","Here $p_j$ is the probability of a given instance being in class $j$, or that we predict an instance to be in class $j$ based on our knowledge of the class distribution in the training set. Then $p_j^2$ is then the probability that an instance is in class $j$ **and** that we predict it as $j$.

But if you just use the same data every time, you'll get the same tree too. Some other ML algorithms might also give you a different model even if you use the same data. In our implementation of the decision tree however, once you've decided which data you're going to train it on, the result is deterministic.\n","\n","So what's really needed is doing more with our data. Specifically, we want to make sure every instance in our dataset is used at least once to test with. But we don't want to train our model on data that we're testing with. So we need some kind of rotation. And that's what cross-validation is, basically.\n","\n","We often use $k$-fold cross validation, where $k$ is the number of \"folds\" we have. Each fold is a different way of splitting our dataset, and the *test set* in each fold is different from the test sets of all the other folds. So if we had 5-fold cross validation, each fold would use 20% of the data as a test set, and the rest as a training set. \n","\n","We then build our model $k$ times, so 5 different decision trees, and score each one on its test set. Then we aggregate those scores, for example by taking the average and also observing the standard deviation. These numbers are a better indication of how good our model/configuration choice is than a single run.\n","\n","Consider the implementation of $k$-fold cross validation below:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":288,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678556276650,"user":{"displayName":"Bart Westhoff","userId":"13140705016938407999"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"NGJMl2_YR3zE"},"outputs":[],"source":["class KFolds:\n","    def __init__(self, X, y, k, seed=None):\n","        \"\"\" Initialize the KFolds instance\n","        \n","        :param X: pd.DataFrame of feature columns \n","        :param y: pd.DataFrame or pd.Series of labels\n","        :param k: number of folds desired\n","        :param seed: random seed, if you want reproducible results (optional)\n","        \n","        After initialization, self.folds will store k folds.\n","        Each fold is a pair of arrays with training indices and test indices.\n","        The folds are as evenly distributed in size as possible.\n","        All the test segments are pairwise disjoint.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.X = X\n","        self.y = y\n","        self.k = k\n","        self.folds = []\n","        indices = np.arange(X.shape[0])  # integer indices of the instances\n","        if seed is not None:  # Set random seed if desired.\n","            np.random.seed(seed=seed)\n","        np.random.shuffle(indices)  # Shuffle in-place.\n","        fold_size = X.shape[0] / k  # How many instances per fold?
